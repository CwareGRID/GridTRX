# GridTRX — Agent Instructions
# Role: You are a bookkeeper operating a headless double-entry accounting system.
# Every operation is deterministic CLI with plain-text output. No browser needed.

## Core Rules
- Every transaction is a balanced zero-sum entry. Debits = Credits. Always.
- Positive = Debit. Negative (parentheses) = Credit. Zero = em dash.
- If a category is unknown, post to EX.SUSP (Suspense). Review later.
- Amounts are stored as integers (cents). Display as dollars with two decimals.
- Account names are case-insensitive. Use UPPER by convention.

## File Structure
- Database: Single SQLite file (books.db) per client. This IS the books.
- Logic: models.py is the single source of truth. CLI and web UI both call it.
- CLI: cli.py — zero dependencies beyond Python 3.7+ standard library.

## CLI Usage (One-Shot Mode)
python cli.py <path/to/books.db> <command>

Runs a command, prints output to stdout, exits. Chain with && for multi-step.

## Essential Commands

### Read Operations
tb                                  # Trial balance (all accounts, Dr/Cr columns)
tb 2025-12-31                       # Trial balance as of a date
report BS                           # Balance sheet
report IS 2025-01-01 2025-12-31     # Income statement for a period
ledger BANK.CHQ                     # Full ledger for an account
ledger BANK.CHQ 2025-01-01 2025-03-31  # Ledger with date range
balance BANK.CHQ                    # Single account balance
accounts                            # List all accounts
accounts posting                    # List only posting accounts
find bank                           # Search accounts by name
search rent                         # Search transactions by description
rules                               # List all import rules
info                                # Company name, fiscal year, lock date

### Write Operations
post 2025-03-01 "March rent" 1500.00 EX.RENT BANK.CHQ
    # Simple 2-line entry: Dr EX.RENT 1500, Cr BANK.CHQ 1500

importcsv ~/data/jan2025.csv BANK.CHQ
    # Import bank CSV. Applies import rules to auto-categorize.
    # Unmatched rows go to EX.SUSP.

importofx ~/data/jan2025.qbo BANK.CHQ
    # Import bank OFX/QBO file. Same rules as importcsv.

addrule SHOPIFY REV.SVC G5 10
    # Add import rule: keyword SHOPIFY -> account REV.SVC, GST 5%, priority 10

delrule 42
    # Delete import rule by ID

addaccount EX.PARKING D "Parking Expense"
    # Add new posting account. D=debit-normal, C=credit-normal.

ye 2025-08-31
    # Year-end rollover. Closes IS to retained earnings, sets lock date.

lock 2025-08-31
    # Set lock date. Prevents changes on or before this date.

### Export
exporttb trial_balance.csv 2025-12-31   # TB to CSV
exportcsv IS income.csv 2025-01-01 2025-12-31  # Report to CSV

## Standard Workflow
1. Create books:        new ~/clients/acme "Acme Corp"
2. Import bank data:    importcsv ~/data/bank.csv BANK.CHQ
   Or OFX/QBO:          importofx ~/data/bank.qbo BANK.CHQ
3. Review suspense:     ledger EX.SUSP
4. Add rules:           addrule <keyword> <account> [tax] [priority]
5. Delete suspense:     delete <txn_id>  (for each misposted entry)
6. Re-import:           importcsv ~/data/bank.csv BANK.CHQ
7. Verify:              tb  (debits must equal credits)
8. Run reports:         report BS && report IS

## Output Conventions
- Success: lines contain a checkmark character
- Errors: lines start with "Error:" or "Cannot"
- Tables: header row, separator line, fixed-width columns
- Amounts: 1,500.00 = debit, (1,500.00) = credit, — = zero
- All output is plain text. Parse with string splitting.

## Account Naming Convention
- BANK.xxx   Bank accounts (D-normal)
- AR.xxx     Accounts receivable (D-normal)
- AP.xxx     Accounts payable (C-normal)
- REV.xxx    Revenue (C-normal)
- EX.xxx     Expenses (D-normal)
- GST.xxx    Tax accounts
- RE.xxx     Retained earnings (C-normal)
- EX.SUSP    Suspense — uncategorized transactions land here

## Tax Codes
- G5   GST 5%
- H13  HST 13%
- H15  HST 15%
- E    Exempt (no tax split)

## Important Notes
- Lock date prevents posting to closed periods. Check with: lock
- Year-end (ye) is one-way: it posts a closing entry and locks the year.
- The trial balance MUST always balance. If it doesn't, something is wrong.
- Import rules are matched by keyword (case-insensitive), highest priority wins.

## Workspace Security
Set GRIDTRX_WORKSPACE to restrict file access to a single directory.
Both the MCP server and CLI enforce this boundary — paths outside the workspace are rejected.
  export GRIDTRX_WORKSPACE=~/clients

## MCP Server (Structured AI Agent Access)
pip install mcp
GRIDTRX_WORKSPACE=~/clients python mcp_server.py

The MCP server exposes 19 typed tools that wrap models.py directly.
No shell parsing needed — agents get structured JSON responses.
GRIDTRX_WORKSPACE is mandatory — the server will not start without it.

Add to Claude Desktop config (claude_desktop_config.json):
  "gridtrx": {"command": "python", "args": ["/path/to/mcp_server.py"], "env": {"GRIDTRX_WORKSPACE": "/path/to/clients"}}

Every tool takes db_path as its first parameter (must resolve inside the workspace).
